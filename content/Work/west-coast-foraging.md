Every conscientious hiker practises the principle of leave no trace. If your campground shows any more sign that you were there than a patch of flattened grass then you’re doing it wrong. Much as I respect this, I’ve been guilty of returning from a hike having got through far too many single use plastics: ziploc bags, cereal bar wrappers, soggy socks wrapped in carrier bags. I set myself the challenge to go on a multiday hike with none of the waste, from Hayle to Penzance along the South West Coast Path. I wrote all about it for Run Wild Magazine, available to order in print here:
